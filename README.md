# Acquiring data from EyeX by tobii

Download and put the folder ClientMinimalAllDataStream in the SDK/samples/ folder

If you want to compile load the project out of that path remember to:

1. (Text) Edit the project to remove the custom MSBuild (CopyEyeXDllToOutputDirectory.targets)
2. Change the Include paths (For Debug and Release)
3. Change the Lib paths (For Debug and Release)
